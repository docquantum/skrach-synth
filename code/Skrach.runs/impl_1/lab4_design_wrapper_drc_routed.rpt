BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer lab4_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_lab4_design_mig_7series_0_7_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[0].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs/IBUFDS_0 (in lab4_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_lab4_design_mig_7series_0_7_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[0].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer lab4_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_lab4_design_mig_7series_0_7_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[1].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs/IBUFDS_0 (in lab4_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_lab4_design_mig_7series_0_7_mig/u_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/gen_dqs_iobuf_HR.gen_dqs_iobuf[1].gen_dqs_diff.u_iobuf_dqs macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal lab4_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_lab4_design_mig_7series_0_7_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the lab4_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_lab4_design_mig_7series_0_7_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of lab4_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_lab4_design_mig_7series_0_7_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port scl_0 expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port sda_0 expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
