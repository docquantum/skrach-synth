TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock skrach_design_i/lab4_ip_0/U0/lab4_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dp_inst/audio_inst/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_skrach_design_clk_wiz_1_2 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_skrach_design_clk_wiz_1_2 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_skrach_design_clk_wiz_1_2] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_skrach_design_clk_wiz_1_2 and clk_out2_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_skrach_design_clk_wiz_1_2] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_skrach_design_clk_wiz_1_2 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_skrach_design_clk_wiz_1_2] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock skrach_design_i/lab4_ip_0/U0/lab4_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dp_inst/audio_inst/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin skrach_design_i/lab4_ip_0/U0/lab4_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dp_inst/audio_inst/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '24' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
